I am endlessly fascinated + inspired by our Mother Earth and each of her wondrous details teaches me a lesson.
This is the space where I share how I see her through my photography. 
Please enjoy and revisit as I add more from my adventures! 

If you would like to connect, email me at c.bee.eff@gmail.com.
